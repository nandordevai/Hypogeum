# Albums

Apocryphos' 2016 album, Stone Speak, explores the cultic spaces of death. It mixes recordings made in cemeteries and ghost towns with slow, deep drones and ambient elements.

Brooddark's first solo album, Overvoltage, is out now. It features futuristic, industrial drones and a dark, soundtrack-like, powerful sci-fi sound.

For those who like a more melancholic, dreamy sound, I recommend the album Night Moss by Teahouse Radio and Skeldos (Pär Boström and Vytenis Eitminavičius).

A similar style is Ronny Engmann and Karina Dorin's album Never Sleep Again, a dark/deep ambient based on vocals and experimental soundscapes.

Finally, I want to recommend an album that sits a little outside the usual Hypogeum territory. Still, with Pär Boström’s name attached, readers can be sure the music — sometimes edging into winter or dungeon synth — will resonate here. I’ll wrap up this week’s recommendation with Star Lore (2023), from Boström’s project Aindulmedir.
