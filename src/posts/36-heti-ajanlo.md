First up is the debut album from Kristof Bathory (Dawn of Ashes) and his new dark ambient side project, Bleak Haven. Oblivion dives into dark space ambient territory with subtle hints of horror.

Insectarium sets a similarly moody tone with their latest release, Replicant. This one leans toward sci-fi, featuring colder soundscapes and layered drones.

The same artist also released another album back in August, but due to the summer break, Witness This Strange World Unfold is only coming to light now.

Finally, there’s a new Kult of O mixtape, featuring Void Gazer, Steve Roach, and many more artists.
