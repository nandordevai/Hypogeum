Two weeks’ worth of recommendations are coming out together this time — I’ve slowed down a bit; it’s summer, it’s hot, that’s how it is. In return, I tried to gather enough so that you’ll have something to listen to for an entire vacation.

To start, here’s Oneirich’s new mixtape — less ambient, more pulsing, travel-like rhythmic tracks:

Let’s not forget the usual Nacht either — the July 27 mixtape:

I already recommended Ajna last time, now here’s a new release from them (under another name, as Segment.fault).

Caldon Glover’s Eternal Night Radio album also came out recently — I unfairly forgot about it, but I’m making up for that now.

Also a new release: a compilation inspired by the film Eraserhead, featuring tracks by Grey Frequency and Sonologyst, among others.

And since I mentioned Sonologyst, here’s one of his older albums from 2015 — Ancient Death Cults and Beliefs.

Something special from 2020: a recording of a performance without an audience, a collaboration between Inade and Circular — The Saturnine Broadcasting.

And let’s close with Oneirich again, who recently put together an industrial mixtape as well.

That’s all for this round of recommendations, I wish everyone a great summer holiday! I’ve added all I could. Since I’ll be going on vacation soon too, expect new posts in the last week of August.
