In the first Unearthed after the summer break, we’re tuning in to the collaboration between Kloob and Onasander on their album Goês. Its slow, pulsing drones conjure the spirit of the dead in the final chapter of the Witchcraft trilogy.

Sonologyst’s album Planetarium is a musical disovery of the Solar System using recordings from NASA. It’s cosmic ambient in the truest sense of the word.

Finally, we have another space/dark ambient release from Joel Gilardini, who makes experimental sound textures from guitar recordings to create slow, immersive tracks.
