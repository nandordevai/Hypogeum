Astoreth & Forestaal deliver a nearly forty-minute improvisation, a musical ritual built from drones and vocals.

Stepping outside the usual genre boundaries, this week I’m also highlighting a Swedish neoclassical-darkwave band, Arcana. Their 2012 album *“As Bright As A Thousand Suns”*, originally released on Cyclic Law, is now available again on CD and vinyl.

Kloob and Onasander’s [previous collaboration](https://winter-light.bandcamp.com/album/go-s) was already featured in an earlier recommendation, and now they return with a new joint project: Ethnea Nekrōn. Their release *Exo-Metempsychosis* explores the theme of cosmic rebirth through dark and space ambient textures.

From Helsinki comes Ruusuriimu (Csipkebogyó), offering transcendental apocalyptic folk with a touch of Hungarian connection. Their new album, “Tánc a rothadásért”, features Hungarian vocalists Vály Tekla and Csiszér Réka. Tekla also contributes lyrics and the cover photograph.
